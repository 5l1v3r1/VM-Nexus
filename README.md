# VM-Nexus
Multi-platform QEMU-KVM installer and custom feature support utility.


This repository contains parts of a project I am currently working on. The `installer.py` file is the component responsible for 
installing QEMU and related utilities on most popular platforms. While the scripts posted here should work for the most part please keep in mind that they are components of a bigger application. The end result will be a feature rich Virtual Machine managing app with a focus on automation. A script is planned, in example, that will automate the execution of complex commands such as those that have to do with changing one VM format to another or configuring certain aspects of said VM. A GUI for most of these operations is planned.

### Note

This is a work in progress, as such you may encounter a bug while testing one or more of these scripts out.
