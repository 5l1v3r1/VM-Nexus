# VM-Nexus
Multi-platform installer and wrapper for QEMU-KVM.


This repository contains components of a project i have been working on. The `installer.py` file is the component responsible for 
installing QEMU and related utilities on most popular platforms.

### Note

This is a work in progress, while the installer should work it is a small component of a program that i am currently developing. The full app will make using QEMU-KVM related utilities and it's various complex features, easy to use. A GUI for VM-Nexus is planned.
